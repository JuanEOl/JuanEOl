## Hi there 👋
I'm a software developer who enjoys building fast, scalable, and well-structured applications. I’ve worked on both the backend and frontend, and I’m comfortable with DevOps and cloud stuff too. I like designing solid systems, writing clean code, and keeping up with the latest tech trends.
